  <section id="overview">
    <h2>📈 NVIDIA's Stock Surge in Late 2024</h2>
    <p>NVIDIA's stock experienced a dramatic surge in the second half of 2024. This surge was primarily driven by
      exponential growth in its data center business, fueled by skyrocketing demand for AI workloads and GPU acceleration
      in cloud infrastructure.</p>
    <p>As generative AI exploded across industries, hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Web Services made
      massive capital investments into NVIDIA’s H100 and A100 GPU units. As a result, NVIDIA’s revenue from its Data Center
      segment doubled YoY, pushing its market capitalization beyond $2.5 trillion by year-end 2024.</p>

  <section id="gpu-tech">
    <h2>💡 How GPUs Work & NVIDIA’s Innovation</h2>
    <p>GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are designed for parallel computation. While CPUs handle sequential tasks, GPUs
      manage thousands of concurrent threads, making them ideal for training AI models, video rendering, and simulations.</p>
    <p>NVIDIA pioneered CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), enabling developers to write general-purpose code for
      GPUs. This innovation was a turning point, allowing deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch to leverage
      GPU acceleration.</p>
    <p>AMD, a key competitor, provides high-performance GPUs like the MI300X and ROCm software stack. However, NVIDIA’s
      ecosystem dominance, combined with CUDA and hardware-software integration, gave it a decisive edge in AI and data
      centers.</p>

  <section id="data-centers">
    <h2>🏢 Data Centers</h2>
    <p>The Data Center segment became NVIDIA's largest revenue driver in 2024, fueled by demand for AI and HPC workloads.
      Flagship products like the H100 Tensor Core GPU and Grace Hopper Superchip enabled unprecedented performance gains
      for hyperscalers and enterprises.</p>
    <p>NVIDIA’s ecosystem — including CUDA, cuDNN, and AI SDKs — locks in developers, making switching costly. Partnerships
      with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Meta fortified recurring revenue and expanded industry adoption.</p>
    <p>This growth transformed NVIDIA into a backbone for AI infrastructure worldwide, underpinning advancements in
      healthcare, automotive, and cloud computing.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="amd-competitors">
    <h2>🆚 AMD & Competitors</h2>
    <p>AMD, Intel, and other GPU and AI chipmakers remain key competitors in both consumer and data center segments.</p>
    <p>AMD’s MI300X accelerators and ROCm software stack target HPC and AI workloads but have yet to match NVIDIA’s developer
      ecosystem or market penetration.</p>
    <p>Intel focuses on its Habana AI chips and integrated graphics solutions, while startups like Graphcore and Cerebras
      push niche AI architectures.</p>
    <p>NVIDIA’s early investment in software, silicon design, and large-scale fabrication partnerships gives it a durable
      moat.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="board-relationships">
    <h2>👔 Board Relationships</h2>
    <p>Interesting overlaps exist between NVIDIA and competitors via board members and executives, affecting strategy and
      partnerships.</p>
    <p>For example, some former AMD executives have transitioned into advisory roles at NVIDIA, creating informal channels
      for industry insights.</p>
    <p>Several large institutional investors hold significant shares across NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel, potentially influencing
      governance and competitive dynamics.</p>
